# Netflix-Recommendation-System
Here, I am trying to make different types of recommendation Systems on Netflix Data which is published as a part of the competition 2 years back.
So first of all, let me mention that the data is a bit large, that is 2 Gb and contains about 10 crores of ratings by different users on the Netflix TV shows and movies.
Training part was the most hectic one in this project and if you are working this project and do not have much hardware resources  i suggest you to load much lesser data to work.
# Dataset
As you can see in the code, there are 10,04,80,507 ratings outhere which is been given by 4,80,189 different viewers for 17,770 feature movies. The dataset is quite large and we have to use good hardware resources to work on it even with a tactical approach.The dataset is published as a part of the competition on Kaggle 2 years back. The link to the Dataset is given below.
